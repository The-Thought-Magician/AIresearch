## 2: Foundations of Human Memory and AI Architectures

### 2.1 Understanding Human Brain Memory: Storage, Retrieval, and Adaptation

Memory is one of the defining characteristics of human intelligence, enabling individuals to **store, retrieve, and adapt knowledge over time**. Unlike artificial systems, which often rely on **pre-programmed logic and structured data storage**, the human brain dynamically encodes, updates, and reorganizes information in response to new experiences. Recent neuroscience and cognitive science breakthroughs have revealed the **intricate mechanisms underlying human memory**, offering new insights into how artificial intelligence (AI) systems can **replicate biological memory storage and learning mechanisms**.

### 2.1.1 The Multi-Level Structure of Human Memory

The human brain operates using a **hierarchical memory system**, integrating multiple levels of storage that serve distinct functional roles:

-   **Sensory Memory**: The shortest form of memory, lasting milliseconds to seconds, which allows humans to process sensory stimuli before deciding whether to retain or discard information.
-   **Short-Term and Working Memory**: Temporarily holds and manipulates information for immediate tasks, relying on **prefrontal cortex activity**. This process is critical for reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving.
-   **Long-Term Memory**: Stores information indefinitely, categorized into: **Explicit (Declarative) Memory**: Facts and events consciously recalled, such as **episodic memory** (personal experiences) and **semantic memory** (general knowledge). **Implicit (Non-Declarative) Memory**: Unconscious memory processes, such as **procedural memory** (motor skills) and **associative learning**.

Each memory type interacts through **neural networks across different brain regions**, primarily involving the **hippocampus, neocortex, and limbic system**. Unlike traditional AI architectures, which rely on static and rigid memory storage, **the brain dynamically reorganizes stored knowledge to adapt to new inputs**.

### 2.1.2 Synaptic Plasticity and the Biological Basis of Memory Storage

The brain's fundamental mechanism of memory formatio**n** is **synaptic plasticity**, which allows neurons to modify their connections based on experience. Key processes include:

-   **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**: Strengthening synapses when two neurons fire simultaneously leads to more efficient information transmission.
-   **Long-Term Depression (LTD)**: Weakening of synaptic strength to remove redundant or outdated memories.
-   **Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC)**: A process in which weakly activated synapses are reinforced if associated with a strong learning signal, allowing for **efficient consolidation of relevant information**.

These mechanisms enable the brain to **prioritize critical knowledge, prune unnecessary connections, and maintain memory efficiency over time**.

### 2.1.3 Dynamic Memory Resetting and the Role of Sleep in Learning
