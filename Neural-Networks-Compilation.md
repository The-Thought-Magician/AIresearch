**_A neural network is defined as a software solution that leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms to ‘mimic’ the operations of a human brain. Neural networks process data more efficiently and feature improved pattern recognition and problem-solving capabilities when compared to traditional computers. This article talks about neural networks’ meaning, working, types, and applications._**

**A neural network is a software solution that leverages** [**machine learning (ML)**](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-ml/ "machine learning (ML)") **algorithms to ‘mimic’ the operations of a human brain. Neural networks process data more efficiently and feature improved pattern recognition and problem-solving capabilities when compared to traditional computers. Neural networks are also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs).**

Neural networks are a subtype of machine learning and an essential element of [deep learning algorithms](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-deep-learning/ "deep learning algorithms"). Just like its functionality, the architecture of a neural network is also based on the human brain. Its highly interlinked structure allows it to imitate the signaling processes of biological neurons.

**

The architecture of a neural network comprises node layers that are distributed across an input layer, single or multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Nodes are ‘artificial neurons’ linked to each other and are associated with a particular weight and threshold. Once the output of a single node crosses its specified threshold, that particular node is activated, and its data is transmitted to the next layer in the network. If the threshold value of the node is not crossed, data is not transferred to the next network layer.

Unlike traditional computers, which process data sequentially, neural networks can learn and multitask. In other words, while conventional computers only follow the instructions of their programming, neural networks continuously evolve through advanced algorithms. It can be said that neural computers ‘program themselves’ to derive solutions to previously unseen problems.

Additionally, traditional computers operate using logic functions based on a specific set of calculations and rules. Conversely, neural computers can process logic functions and raw inputs such as images, videos, and voice.

While traditional computers are ready to go out of the box, neural networks must be ‘trained’ over time to increase their accuracy and efficiency. Fine-tuning these learning machines for accuracy pays rich dividends, giving users a powerful computing tool in [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-ai/ "artificial intelligence (AI)") and computer science applications.

Neural networks are capable of classifying and clustering data at high speeds. This means, among other things, that they can complete the recognition of speech and images within minutes instead of the hours that it would take when carried out by human experts. The most commonly used neural network today is Google search algorithms.

## How Does a Neural Network Work?

The ability of a neural network to ‘think’ has revolutionized computing as we know it. These smart solutions are capable of interpreting data and accounting for context.

Four **critical steps** that neural networks take to operate effectively are:

-   **Associating** or training enables neural networks to ‘remember’ patterns. If the computer is shown an unfamiliar pattern, it will associate the pattern with the closest match present in its memory.
-   **Classification** or organizing data or patterns into predefined classes.
-   **Clustering** or the identification of a unique aspect of each data instance to classify it even without any other context present.
-   **Prediction,** or the production of expected results using a relevant input, even when all context is not provided upfront.

Neural networks require high throughput to carry out these functions accurately in near real-time. This is achieved by deploying numerous processors to operate parallel to each other, which are arranged in tiers.

The neural networking process begins with the first tier receiving the raw input data. You can compare this to the optic nerves of a human being receiving visual inputs. After that, each consecutive tier gets the results from the preceding one. This goes on until the final tier has processed the information and produced the output.

Every individual processing node contains its database, including all its past learnings and the rules that it was either programmed with originally or developed over time. These nodes and tiers are all highly interconnected.

The learning process (also known as training) begins once a neural network is structured for a specific application. Training can take either a supervised approach or an unsupervised approach. In the former, the network is provided with correct outputs either through the delivery of the desired input and output combination or the manual assessment of network performance. On the other hand, unsupervised training occurs when the network interprets inputs and generates results without external instruction or support.

Adaptability is one of the essential qualities of a neural network. This characteristic allows [machine learning algorithms](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/top-ml-algorithms/ "machine learning algorithms") to be modified as they learn from their training and subsequent operations. Learning models are fundamentally centered around the weightage of input streams, wherein, each node assigns a weight to the input data it receives from its preceding nodes. Inputs that prove instrumental to deriving the correct answers are given higher weightage in subsequent processes.

Apart from adaptability, neural networks leverage numerous principles to define their operating rules and make determinations. Fuzzy logic, gradient-based training, Bayesian methods, and genetic algorithms all play a role in the decision-making process at the node level. This helps individual nodes decide what should be sent ahead to the next tier based on the inputs received from the preceding tier.

Basic rules on object relationships can also help ensure higher quality data modeling. For instance, a facial recognition neural network can be instructed ‘teeth are always below the nose’ or ‘ears are on each side of a face’. Adding such rules manually can help decrease training time and aid in the creation of a more efficient neural network model.

However, the addition of rules is not always a good thing. Doing so can also lead to incorrect assumptions when the algorithm tries to solve problems unrelated to the rules. Preloading the wrong ruleset can lead to the creation of neural networks that provide irrelevant, incorrect, unhelpful, or counterproductive results. This makes it essential to choose the rules that are added to the system carefully.

While neural networking, and especially unsupervised learning, still have a long way to go before attaining perfection, we might be closer to achieving a defining breakthrough than we think. It is a fact that the connections within a neural network are nowhere as numerous or efficient as those in the human brain. However, Moore’s Law, which states that the average processing power of computers is expected to double every two years, is still flourishing. This trend gives our expectations from AI and neural networks a definitive direction.

## Types of Neural Networks

Neural networks are classified based on several factors, including their depth, the number of hidden layers, and the I/O capabilities of each node.

![Types of Neural Networks](https://zd-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20050302/Types-of-Neural-Networks.png)

**Types of Neural Networks**

Listed below are the six key types of neural networks.

### 1. Convolutional neural networks

Being a highly popular neural networking model, convolutional neural networks leverage a type of multilayer perceptron and include one or more convolutional layers. These layers can be either pooled or entirely connected.

This neural networking model uses principles from [linear algebra](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-linear-regression/ "linear algebra"), especially matrix multiplication, to detect and process patterns within images. The convolutional layers in this model can create feature maps that capture a specific area within a visual input. The site is then broken down further and analyzed to generate valuable outputs.

Convolutional neural networks are beneficial for AI-powered image recognition applications. This type of neural network is commonly used in advanced use cases such as facial recognition, natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and image classification. It is also deployed for paraphrase identification and signal processing.

### 2. Deconvolutional neural networks

Deconvolutional neural networks work on the same principles as convolutional networks, except in reverse. This specific application of AI aims to detect lost signals or features that may have previously been discarded as unimportant as the convolutional neural network was executing its assigned task. Deconvolution neural networks are helpful for various applications, including image analysis and synthesis.

### 3. Recurrent neural networks

This complex neural network model works by saving the output generated by its processor nodes and feeding them back into the algorithm. This process enables recurrent neural networks to enhance their prediction capabilities.

In this neural network model, each node behaves like a memory cell. These cells work to ensure intelligent computation and implementation by processing the data they receive. However, what sets this model apart is its ability to recollect and reuse all processed data.

A strong feedback loop is one of the critical features of a recurrent neural network. These neural network solutions can ‘self-learn’ from their mistakes. If an incorrect prediction is made, the system learns from feedback and strives to make the correct prediction while passing the data through the algorithm the second time.

Recurrent neural networks are commonly used in text-to-speech applications and for sales forecasting and stock market predictions.

### 4. Feed-forward neural networks

This simple neural network variant passes data in a single direction through various processing nodes until the data reaches the output node. Feed-forward neural networks are designed to process large volumes of ‘noisy’ data and create ‘clean’ outputs. This type of neural network is also known as the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) model.

A feed-forward neural network architecture includes the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Despite their alternate name, these models leverage sigmoid neurons rather than perceptrons, thus allowing them to address nonlinear, real-world problems.

Feed-forward neural networks are the foundation for facial recognition, [natural language processing](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/speech-recognition-software/ "natural language processing"), [computer vision](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-computer-vision/ "computer vision"), and other neural network models.

### 5. Modular neural networks

Modular neural networks feature a series of independent neural networks whose operations are overseen by an intermediary. Each independent network is a ‘module’ that uses distinct inputs to complete a particular part of the larger network’s overall objective.

The modules do not communicate with one another or interfere with each other’s processes while computation occurs. This makes performing extensive and complex computational processes more efficient and quick.

### 6. Generative adversarial networks

Generative adversarial networks are a generative modeling solution that leverages convolutional neural networks and other deep learning offerings to automate the discovery of patterns in data. Generative modeling uses unsupervised learning to generate plausible conclusions from an original dataset.

Generative adversarial networks train generative models by creating a ‘supervised learning problem’ containing a generator model and a discriminator model. The former is prepared to develop new conclusions from the input. At the same time, the latter strives to label generated conclusions as either ‘real’ (from within the dataset) or ‘fake’ (generated by the algorithm). Once the discriminator model labels the generated conclusions wrongly about half the time, the generator model produces plausible conclusions.

## Top 8 Applications of Neural Networks in 2022

From finance and social media to law and order, neural networks are everywhere today. The following are the top eight applications of neural networks in 2022.

### 1. Law and order

Even though their use is restricted in certain jurisdictions, facial recognition systems are gaining popularity as a robust form of surveillance. These solutions match human faces against a database of digital images. Apart from alerting authorities about the presence of fugitives and enforcing mask mandates, this neural networking offering is also useful for enabling selective entry to sensitive physical locations, such as an office.

Convolutional neural networks are most commonly used for this application, as this subtype of neural network is apt for image processing. A high volume of images is stored in the database and further processed during learning.

To ensure effective evaluations, sampling layers are used in the neural network. This helps optimize the models and guarantee accurate results. 

### 2. Finance

In the past, financial markets were subject to risks that were almost impossible to predict. Today, this is no longer true–neural networks have helped mitigate the high volatility in stock markets to a noticeable extent.

Multilayer perceptron neural networks are deployed to help financial executives make accurate stock market predictions in real-time. These solutions use the past performance of stocks, non-profit ratios, and annual returns to provide correct outputs.

### 3. Social media

In the post-pandemic world, social media has reached almost every niche of human life. Users often marvel at how social media platforms can ‘read their minds’, while in reality, they have neural networks to thank for that.

User behavior analysis is a popular application of neural networking tools. Large volumes of user-generated content are processed and analyzed by neural networks every minute. The goal is to glean valuable insights from every tap a user makes within the app. This information is then used to push targeted advertisements based on user activity, preferences, and spending habits.

### 4. Aerospace

Neural networking plays a critical role across the aerospace industry, from engineering to flight.

During the manufacturing process, neural networks are deployed for flawless fault diagnosis, as even the tiniest defect in an aircraft could lead to the loss of hundreds of lives.

At the operator training stage, these systems are used in modeling critical dynamic simulations to ensure that the crew is adequately aware of how real-life flights work.

Finally, during a flight, neural network algorithms bolster passenger safety by ensuring the accurate operation and security of autopilot systems.

### 5. Defense

With 2022 seeing an increase in geopolitical instability across Asia and Europe, proven defense solutions are becoming extremely important for every country. A robust defense posture enables a country to gain favorable recognition on the global stage.

Neural networks are playing an increasingly valuable role in the defense operations of nations with technologically advanced militaries. Neural network solutions are already being used by the militaries of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Japan to develop powerful defense strategies.

In the military, neural networks are leveraged in object location, armed attack analysis, logistics, automated drone control, and air and maritime patrols. For instance, autonomous vehicles powered with convolutional neural network solutions are deployed to look for underwater mines.

### 6. Healthcare

Image-based tests are a core pillar of the healthcare industry, leveraging the image processing prowess of convolutional neural networks to detect diseases.

This type of neural network is seen in various cutting-edge healthcare applications, including the processing of X-rays, CT scans, and ultrasounds. The data collected from the aforementioned medical imaging tests is analyzed by automated solutions to provide actionable medical insights.

Additionally, generative neural networks are being used in drug discovery research. These solutions simplify the classification of different drug categories. New drug combinations are discovered by rapidly merging the properties of various elements and reporting the findings.

### 7. Signature and handwriting analysis

AI-powered signature verification solutions are slowly becoming the norm in financial, administrative, and related domains. Financial institutions and bureaucracies rely on signature verification to verify the identity of end-users and prevent fraudulent transactions.

Until the last decade, analysis of signatures by human clerical staff was the standard for verifying the authenticity of documentation, making fraud easy to commit. However, with the advent of neural networks for signature verification, differentiating between genuine and forged signatures (both online and offline) has become more accessible.

Handwriting analysis is a related application of neural networks that plays a vital role in forensics. AI-backed handwriting analysis is used to evaluate handwritten documents for numerous purposes, including identity verification and behavioral analysis.

### 8. Meteorology

Meteorology is a vital part of daily life, helping people prepare for oncoming weather conditions in advance and even predicting the possibility of natural disasters. With neural networking entering the meteorology domain, weather forecasts become more accurate.

Convolutional neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and recurrent neural networks are being used to boost the accuracy of weather forecasts. Multilayer neural network models are being shown to predict the weather accurately up to 15 days in advance.

Data such as relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiations, and wind speed are used to train neural network models for meteorology applications. Different neural network types are also being combined as researchers strive to forecast the weather accurately.

## **An Introduction to Artificial Neural Network**

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a fundamental concept in [deep learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-deep-learning/) within artificial intelligence. They are crucial in handling complex application scenarios that traditional [machine-learning algorithms](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/most-used-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/) may struggle with. Here’s an overview of how neural networks operate and their components:

-   **Inspired by Biology  
    **ANNs are inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. Just as neurons activate under specific conditions to trigger actions in the body, artificial neurons in ANNs activate based on input data.

-   **Structure of ANNs  
    **ANNs consist of layers of interconnected artificial neurons. These neurons are organized into layers, each performing specific computations using activation functions to decide which signals to pass onto the next layer.

-   **Training Process  
    **During training, ANNs adjust internal parameters known as weights. These weights are initially random and are optimized through a process called [backpropagation](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/backpropagation-algorithm/), where the network learns to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs (loss function).

**Components of Neural Networks:**

-   **Weights:** Numeric values multiplied by inputs and adjusted during training to minimize error.
-   **Activation Function:** Determines whether a neuron should be activated (“fired”) based on its input, introducing non-linearity crucial for complex mappings.

**Layers of Neural Networks**

-   **Input Layer:** Receives input data and represents the dimensions of the input vector.
-   **Hidden Layers:** Intermediary layers between input and output that perform computations using weighted inputs and activation functions.
-   **Output Layer:** Produces the neural network’s final output after processing through the hidden layers.

Neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex problems. They can learn and adapt to data, and they have wide-ranging applications across industries. This makes them essential for anyone looking to deepen their skills in AI and deep learning.

Types of Neural network

Now, let’s discuss the different types of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)

## **A. Perceptron**

 ![architecture of Perceptron](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blog-images_21_5_2020-01-1024x683.jpg)

Perceptron

The Perceptron model, developed by Minsky and Papert, is one of the simplest and earliest neuron models. As the basic unit of a neural network, it performs computations to detect features or patterns in input data, making it a foundational tool in machine learning.

**Functionality:  
**The Perceptron accepts weighted inputs and applies an activation function to produce an output, which is the final result.  
It is also called a Threshold Logic Unit (TLU), highlighting its role in making binary decisions based on input data.

The Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks. It distinguishes between two categories by defining a hyperplane within the input space. This hyperplane is represented mathematically by the equation:

**w⋅x+b=0**

Here, w represents the weight vector, x denotes the input vector, and b is the bias term. This equation delineates how the Perceptron divides the input space into distinct categories based on the learned weights and bias.

**Advantages of Perceptron**  
Perceptrons can implement Logic Gates like AND, OR, or NAND.

**Disadvantages of Perceptron**  
Perceptrons can only learn linearly separable problems such as boolean AND problem. For non-linear problems such as the boolean XOR problem, it does not work.

## **B. Feed Forward Neural Networks**

Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) are foundational in neural network architecture, particularly in applications where traditional [machine learning algorithms](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/most-used-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/) face limitations. 

They facilitate tasks such as simple classification, [face recognition](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/face-recognition/), [computer vision](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-computer-vision-the-basics/), and [speech recognition](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/speech-recognition-python/) through their uni-directional flow of data.

-   **Structure**  
    FFNNs consist of input and output layers with optional hidden layers in between. Input data travels through the network from input nodes, passing through hidden layers (if present), and culminating in output nodes.

-   **Activation and Propagation**  
    These networks operate via forward propagation, where data moves in one direction without feedback loops. Activation functions like step functions determine whether neurons fire based on weighted inputs. For instance, a neuron may output 1 if its input exceeds a threshold (usually 0), and -1 if it falls below.

FFNNs are efficient for handling noisy data and are relatively straightforward to implement, making them versatile tools in various AI applications.

 ![architecture of Radial Basis Network (RBF)](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blog-images_21_5_2020-02-1024x683.jpg)

A Radial Basis Function Network comprises an input layer followed by RBF neurons and an output layer with nodes corresponding to each category. During classification, the input’s similarity to training set data points, where each neuron stores a prototype, determines the classification.

When classifying a new n-dimensional input vector:

Each neuron computes the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype.

For instance, if we have classes A and B, the input is closer to class A prototypes than class B, leading to classification as class A.

Each RBF neuron measures similarity by outputting a value from 0 to 1. The response is maximal (1) when the input matches the prototype and diminishes exponentially (towards 0) with increasing distance. This response forms a bell curve pattern characteristic of RBF neurons.

    Designed to save the output of a layer, [Recurrent Neural Network](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/recurrent-neural-network/) is fed back to the input to help in predicting the outcome of the layer. The first layer is typically a feed forward neural network followed by recurrent neural network layer where some information it had in the previous time-step is remembered by a memory function. Forward propagation is implemented in this case. It stores information required for it’s future use. If the prediction is wrong, the learning rate is employed to make small changes. Hence, making it gradually increase towards making the right prediction during the backpropagation.

### **Improvement over RNN: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks**

LSTM networks are a type of RNN that uses special units in addition to standard units. LSTM units include a ‘memory cell’ that can maintain information in memory for long periods of time. A set of gates is used to control when information enters the memory when it’s output, and when it’s forgotten. There are three types of gates viz, Input gate, output gate and forget gate. Input gate decides how many information from the last sample will be kept in memory; the output gate regulates the amount of data passed to the next layer, and forget gates control the tearing rate of memory stored. This architecture lets them learn longer-term dependencies

This is one of the implementations of LSTM cells, many other architectures exist.

## **G. Sequence to sequence models**

![Image result for sequence to sequence learning with neural networks](https://miro.medium.com/max/2658/1*Ismhi-muID5ooWf3ZIQFFg.png)

  
A sequence to sequence model consists of two Recurrent Neural Networks. Here, there exists an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that processes the output. The encoder and decoder work simultaneously – either using the same parameter or different ones. This model, on contrary to the actual RNN, is particularly applicable in those cases where the length of the input data is equal to the length of the output data. While they possess similar benefits and limitations of the RNN, these models are usually applied mainly in [chatbots](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/basics-of-building-an-artificial-intelligence-chatbot/), machine translations, and question answering systems.

## **H. Modular Neural Network** 

### **Applications of Modular Neural Network**

1.  **_Stock market prediction systems_**
2.  **_Adaptive MNN for character recognitions_** 
3.  **_Compression of high level input data_**

A modular neural network has a number of different networks that function independently and perform sub-tasks. The different networks do not really interact with or signal each other during the computation process. They work independently towards achieving the output.

![Image result for modular neural networks](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364815204001185-gr1.jpg)

As a result, a large and complex computational process are done significantly faster by breaking it down into independent components. The computation speed increases because the networks are not interacting with or even connected to each other.

### **Advantages of Modular Neural Network**

1.  Efficient
2.  Independent training
3.  Robustness

### **Disadvantages of Modular Neural Network**

1.  Moving target Problems
