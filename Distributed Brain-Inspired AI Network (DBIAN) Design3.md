Distributed Brain-Inspired AI Network (DBIAN) with Evolutionary Features
Introduction
This document extends the Distributed Brain-Inspired AI Network (DBIAN) to incorporate evolutionary features inspired by biological processes, such as node reproduction, death, genetic modification, survival of the fittest, independent communication, and rapid development. Hosted on MCP servers, the system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as nodes, each with tools and vector stores, to mimic the human brain’s adaptability and intelligence. The design leverages neuroevolution principles and draws from neuroscience and AI research to create a dynamic, evolving system.
High-Level Architecture
The DBIAN remains a modular, distributed system with nodes connected in a dynamic graph, orchestrated by a meta-controller, and regulated by global modulators. The addition of evolutionary features enhances adaptability and intelligence.
Components

Nodes (Agents):

Each node is an LLM with:
A vector store for local memory.
Tools (sub-agents) for tasks (e.g., image recognition).
A "genome" defining specialization, tools, connection weights, and hyperparameters.


Specializations: Sensory (e.g., vision), processing (e.g., reasoning), memory, integration, or output.
Evolutionary Role: Nodes evolve through reproduction, mutation, and selection.


Communication Network:

A dynamic graph ( G = (V, E) ), where ( V ) is nodes and ( E ) is weighted connections.
Types: Excitatory, inhibitory, modulatory (inspired by neurotransmitters).
Evolution: Connections evolve by adding/removing edges based on utility.


Meta-Controller:

An LLM-based controller that:
Generates task plans.
Manages evolution (evaluation, selection, reproduction, mutation).
Adjusts global modulators.




Global Workspace:

A shared vector store for integrating information, resembling consciousness theories.


Global Modulators ("Hormones"):

System-wide parameters (e.g., stress hormone, reward signal) that adjust behavior.
Evolution: Modulators influence node fitness and exploration.



Evolutionary Features
The following features are integrated to mimic biological evolution and human intelligence:
1. Evolution and Survival of the Fittest

Mechanism: Nodes are evaluated based on performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, efficiency). High-performing nodes are selected for reproduction, while low-performing ones are removed.
Implementation: The meta-controller uses a fitness function to rank nodes, selecting the top ( k ) for reproduction.

2. Death of Nodes

Mechanism: Nodes with fitness below a threshold or redundant functions are deactivated.
Implementation: Nodes are removed if their average fitness over a period falls below a set threshold.

3. Reproduction of Nodes

Mechanism: New nodes are created by combining traits from two parent nodes.
Genome: Includes specialization, tools, connection weights, and hyperparameters.
Process:
Crossover: Combine parent traits (e.g., average weights, merge vector stores).
Specialization: Inherit from one parent or combine (e.g., vision + language = multimodal).


Implementation: Inspired by NEAT (Neuroevolution), new nodes inherit and modify parent genomes.

4. Genetic Modification

Mechanism: Random mutations are introduced to new nodes for diversity.
Mutations:
Change specialization (e.g., vision to reasoning).
Add/remove tools.
Modify weights or hyperparameters.


Implementation: Apply mutations with a 5-10% probability per trait.

5. Capability of New Findings

Mechanism: Explorer nodes generate new knowledge using generative models or curiosity-driven learning.
Implementation: Reward nodes for discovering novel patterns or solving new tasks, using techniques like variational autoencoders.

6. Gamification

Mechanism: Nodes earn points for achievements (e.g., high accuracy, new discoveries).
Implementation: Points increase fitness scores, influencing reproduction chances.

7. Will to Survive

Mechanism: Nodes improve themselves to avoid elimination.
Implementation: Local learning modules allow nodes to fine-tune on task-specific data.

8. Lifespan of Nodes

Mechanism: Nodes have a predefined lifespan, after which they are retired.
Implementation: Assign a timer (e.g., 1000 time steps) to each node.

9. Independent Communication

Mechanism: Nodes communicate freely based on their logic.
Implementation: Use a decentralized message bus (e.g., RabbitMQ) with evolving connection weights.

10. Genetic Code

Mechanism: Each node has a unique genome defining its characteristics.
Implementation: The genome is a structured representation of specialization, tools, weights, and hyperparameters, used for reproduction and lineage tracking.

11. Rapid Development and Growth

Mechanism: The system scales by adding nodes and connections dynamically.
Implementation: Modular architecture with cloud-based MCP servers for scalability.
