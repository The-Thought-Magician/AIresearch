Diagram Description
The high-level architecture diagram visualizes the DBIAN’s structure, emphasizing its modularity and distributed nature. It includes the following components:

Meta-Controller:

Represented as a large rectangular box at the top, labeled "Meta-Controller (Language Model)".
Connected to the node pool and global modulators via bidirectional arrows, indicating coordination and control.
