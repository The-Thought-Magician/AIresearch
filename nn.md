## **An Introduction to Artificial Neural Network**

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a fundamental concept in [deep learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-deep-learning/) within artificial intelligence. They are crucial in handling complex application scenarios that traditional [machine-learning algorithms](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/most-used-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/) may struggle with. Here’s an overview of how neural networks operate and their components:

-   **Inspired by Biology  
    **ANNs are inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. Just as neurons activate under specific conditions to trigger actions in the body, artificial neurons in ANNs activate based on input data.

-   **Structure of ANNs  
    **ANNs consist of layers of interconnected artificial neurons. These neurons are organized into layers, each performing specific computations using activation functions to decide which signals to pass onto the next layer.

-   **Training Process  
    **During training, ANNs adjust internal parameters known as weights. These weights are initially random and are optimized through a process called [backpropagation](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/backpropagation-algorithm/), where the network learns to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs (loss function).

**Components of Neural Networks:**

-   **Weights:** Numeric values multiplied by inputs and adjusted during training to minimize error.
-   **Activation Function:** Determines whether a neuron should be activated (“fired”) based on its input, introducing non-linearity crucial for complex mappings.

**Layers of Neural Networks**

-   **Input Layer:** Receives input data and represents the dimensions of the input vector.
-   **Hidden Layers:** Intermediary layers between input and output that perform computations using weighted inputs and activation functions.
-   **Output Layer:** Produces the neural network’s final output after processing through the hidden layers.

Neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex problems. They can learn and adapt to data, and they have wide-ranging applications across industries. This makes them essential for anyone looking to deepen their skills in AI and deep learning.

## **Types of Neural Networks**

There are many types of neural networks available or that might be in the development stage. They can be classified depending on their:

-   Structure
-   Data flow
-   Neurons used and their density
-   Layers and their depth activation filters

 ![types of neural networks](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blog-NN-info-22-5-2020-02-min-318x1024.png)

Types of Neural network

Now, let’s discuss the different types of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)

## **A. Perceptron**

 ![architecture of Perceptron](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blog-images_21_5_2020-01-1024x683.jpg)

Perceptron

The Perceptron model, developed by Minsky and Papert, is one of the simplest and earliest neuron models. As the basic unit of a neural network, it performs computations to detect features or patterns in input data, making it a foundational tool in machine learning.

**Functionality:  
**The Perceptron accepts weighted inputs and applies an activation function to produce an output, which is the final result.  
It is also called a Threshold Logic Unit (TLU), highlighting its role in making binary decisions based on input data.

The Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for binary classification tasks. It distinguishes between two categories by defining a hyperplane within the input space. This hyperplane is represented mathematically by the equation:

**w⋅x+b=0**

Here, w represents the weight vector, x denotes the input vector, and b is the bias term. This equation delineates how the Perceptron divides the input space into distinct categories based on the learned weights and bias.

**Advantages of Perceptron**  
Perceptrons can implement Logic Gates like AND, OR, or NAND.

**Disadvantages of Perceptron**  
Perceptrons can only learn linearly separable problems such as boolean AND problem. For non-linear problems such as the boolean XOR problem, it does not work.

## **B. Feed Forward Neural Networks**

Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) are foundational in neural network architecture, particularly in applications where traditional [machine learning algorithms](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/most-used-machine-learning-algorithms-in-python/) face limitations. 

They facilitate tasks such as simple classification, [face recognition](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/face-recognition/), [computer vision](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-computer-vision-the-basics/), and [speech recognition](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/speech-recognition-python/) through their uni-directional flow of data.

-   **Structure**  
    FFNNs consist of input and output layers with optional hidden layers in between. Input data travels through the network from input nodes, passing through hidden layers (if present), and culminating in output nodes.

-   **Activation and Propagation**  
    These networks operate via forward propagation, where data moves in one direction without feedback loops. Activation functions like step functions determine whether neurons fire based on weighted inputs. For instance, a neuron may output 1 if its input exceeds a threshold (usually 0), and -1 if it falls below.

FFNNs are efficient for handling noisy data and are relatively straightforward to implement, making them versatile tools in various AI applications.

The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) represents an entry point into complex neural networks, designed to handle sophisticated tasks in various domains such as:

-   Speech recognition
-   Machine translation
-   Complex classification tasks

MLPs are characterized by their multilayered structure, where input data traverses through interconnected layers of artificial neurons. 

This architecture includes input and output layers alongside multiple hidden layers, typically three or more, forming a fully connected neural network.

**Operation:**

-   **Bidirectional Propagation**  
    Utilizes forward propagation (for computing outputs) and backward propagation (for adjusting weights based on error).

-   **Weight Adjustment**  
    During backpropagation, weights are optimized to minimize prediction errors by comparing predicted outputs against actual training inputs.

-   **Activation Functions**  
    Nonlinear functions are applied to the weighted inputs of neurons, enhancing the network’s capacity to model complex relationships. The output layer often uses softmax activation for multi-class classification tasks.

### **Advantages on Multi-Layer Perceptron**

1.  Used for deep learning \[due to the presence of dense fully connected layers and back propagation\] 

### **Disadvantages on Multi-Layer Perceptron:**

**Structure**

-   **Convolutional Layer**  
    The initial layer processes localized regions of the input data, using filters to extract features like edges and textures from images.

-   **Pooling Layer**Follows convolution to reduce spatial dimensions, capturing essential information while reducing computational complexity.

-   **Fully Connected Layer**  
    Concludes the network, using bidirectional propagation to classify images based on extracted features.

**Operation**

-   **Feature Extraction**

## **E. Radial Basis Function Neural Networks**

 ![architecture of Radial Basis Network (RBF)](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Blog-images_21_5_2020-02-1024x683.jpg)

A Radial Basis Function Network comprises an input layer followed by RBF neurons and an output layer with nodes corresponding to each category. During classification, the input’s similarity to training set data points, where each neuron stores a prototype, determines the classification.

When classifying a new n-dimensional input vector:

Each neuron computes the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype.

For instance, if we have classes A and B, the input is closer to class A prototypes than class B, leading to classification as class A.

Each RBF neuron measures similarity by outputting a value from 0 to 1. The response is maximal (1) when the input matches the prototype and diminishes exponentially (towards 0) with increasing distance. This response forms a bell curve pattern characteristic of RBF neurons.

-   **Image tagger**
-   **[Sentiment Analysis](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/we-used-sentiment-analysis-to-get-more-insights-into-customer-feedback/)**
-   **Translation**  
    Designed to save the output of a layer, [Recurrent Neural Network](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/recurrent-neural-network/) is fed back to the input to help in predicting the outcome of the layer. The first layer is typically a feed forward neural network followed by recurrent neural network layer where some information it had in the previous time-step is remembered by a memory function. Forward propagation is implemented in this case. It stores information required for it’s future use. If the prediction is wrong, the learning rate is employed to make small changes. Hence, making it gradually increase towards making the right prediction during the backpropagation.

### **Advantages of Recurrent Neural Networks**

1.  Model sequential data where each sample can be assumed to be dependent on historical ones is one of the advantage.  
2.  Used with convolution layers to extend the pixel effectiveness.

### **Improvement over RNN: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks**

LSTM networks are a type of RNN that uses special units in addition to standard units. LSTM units include a ‘memory cell’ that can maintain information in memory for long periods of time. A set of gates is used to control when information enters the memory when it’s output, and when it’s forgotten. There are three types of gates viz, Input gate, output gate and forget gate. Input gate decides how many information from the last sample will be kept in memory; the output gate regulates the amount of data passed to the next layer, and forget gates control the tearing rate of memory stored. This architecture lets them learn longer-term dependencies

This is one of the implementations of LSTM cells, many other architectures exist.

## **G. Sequence to sequence models**

![Image result for sequence to sequence learning with neural networks](https://miro.medium.com/max/2658/1*Ismhi-muID5ooWf3ZIQFFg.png)

  
A sequence to sequence model consists of two Recurrent Neural Networks. Here, there exists an encoder that processes the input and a decoder that processes the output. The encoder and decoder work simultaneously – either using the same parameter or different ones. This model, on contrary to the actual RNN, is particularly applicable in those cases where the length of the input data is equal to the length of the output data. While they possess similar benefits and limitations of the RNN, these models are usually applied mainly in [chatbots](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/basics-of-building-an-artificial-intelligence-chatbot/), machine translations, and question answering systems.

## **H. Modular Neural Network** 

### **Applications of Modular Neural Network**

1.  **_Stock market prediction systems_**
2.  **_Adaptive MNN for character recognitions_** 
3.  **_Compression of high level input data_**

A modular neural network has a number of different networks that function independently and perform sub-tasks. The different networks do not really interact with or signal each other during the computation process. They work independently towards achieving the output.

![Image result for modular neural networks](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364815204001185-gr1.jpg)

As a result, a large and complex computational process are done significantly faster by breaking it down into independent components. The computation speed increases because the networks are not interacting with or even connected to each other.

### **Advantages of Modular Neural Network**

1.  Efficient
2.  Independent training
3.  Robustness

### **Disadvantages of Modular Neural Network**

1.  Moving target Problems
